# ToDo
This is my ToDo file for the RunTracker project

- [ ] Figure out "MarkDown" syntax
- [ ] Create proper project layout with STM32CubeMx and System Workbench
- [ ] Post aforementioned project to this GitHub repo
- [ ] Figure out how I'm going to solder the double-sided board when it arrives.  Hint: It may involve solder paste with different reflow temperatures
- [ ] Check out my soldering iron tips to see if I need a new one
