# ToDo
This is my ToDo file for the RunTracker project

- [ ] Figure out "MarkDown" syntax
- [x] Create proper project layout with STM32CubeMx and System Workbench
- [ ] Post aforementioned project to this GitHub repo
- [x] Figure out how I'm going to solder the double-sided board when it arrives.  Hint: It may involve solder paste with different reflow temperatures
- [ ] Check out my soldering iron tips to see if I need a new one

# Assembly Issues
- [ ] Bad solder joint on nav switch right
- [ ] Bad solder joint on PA3 (GPS Output)
- [ ] Bad solder joint on SDIO D1 (R7).  Probably bridged to the SD connector case
- [x] 32kHz crystal does not seem to be working
